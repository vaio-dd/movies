list: doing
date: 2026-02-06

changes:
  - file: styles.css
    description: Added mobile-responsive header-hidden class with transform for hide animation
    lines: "~640-647"
  - file: app.js
    description: Added scroll direction detection and header show/hide logic for mobile
    lines: "~528-548"

gherkin:
  - |
    given: User is on mobile device viewing movie list
    when: user scrolls down the page
    then: header scrolls out of view

  - |
    given: User scrolls up on mobile
    when: header is not visible
    then: header scrolls back into view

  - |
    given: User is at top of page
    when: header is visible
    then: all search/filter controls remain accessible

implementation:
  - Mobile check: window.innerWidth <= 768
  - Hide threshold: scrollY > 100px from top
  - Transition: 0.3s ease transform
  - Hides full header (logo, nav, search, filters)
  - Shows header on any upward scroll

notes:
  - Replaces previous "auto-hide filters only" behavior
  - Full header hides for better mobile viewing experience
  - Ready for QA review
