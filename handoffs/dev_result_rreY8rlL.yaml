    description: Added initial sort by watch_date DESC + title alphabetically on app load
    location: init() function

acceptance_criteria:
  - verified: User views movie list with no manual sort → movies sorted by watch_date DESC
  - verified: New movie with watch_date appears at top of list
  - verified: Same watch_date → secondary sort by title alphabetically

notes:
  - watch_date format: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., "2026-01-31 Friday") - confirmed from data/movies.json
  - Sort applies to both grid and compact views (both use filteredMovies)
  - Primary sort: watch_date descending (newest first)
  - Secondary sort: title alphabetically A-Z
